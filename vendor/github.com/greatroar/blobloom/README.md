Blobloom
========

A Bloom filter package for Go (golang) with no compile-time dependencies.

This package implements a version of Bloom filters called [blocked Bloom filters](
https://www.cs.amherst.edu/~ccmcgeoch/cs34/papers/cacheefficientbloomfilters-jea.pdf),
which get a speed boost from using the CPU cache more efficiently
than regular Bloom filters.

Unlike most Bloom filter packages for Go,
this one doesn't run a hash function for you.
That's a benefit if you need a custom hash
or you want pick the fastest one for an application.

Usage
-----

To construct a Bloom filter, you need to know how many keys you want to store
and what rate of false positives you find acceptable.

	f := blobloom.NewOptimized(blobloom.Config{
		Capacity: nkeys, // Expected number of keys.
		FPRate:   1e-4,  // Accept one false positive per 10,000 lookups.
	})

To add a key:

	// import "github.com/cespare/xxhash/v2"
	f.Add(xxhash.Sum64(key))

To test for the presence of a key in the filter:

	if f.Has(xxhash.Sum64(key)) {
		// Key is probably in f.
	} else {
		// Key is certainly not in f.
	}

The false positive rate is defined as usual:
if you look up 10,000 random keys in a Bloom filter filled to capacity,
an expected one of those is a false positive for FPRate 1e-4.

See the examples/ directory and the
[package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/greatroar/blobloom)
for further usage information and examples.

Hash functions
--------------

Blobloom does not provide hash functions. Instead, it requires client code to
represent each key as a single 64-bit hash value, leaving it to the user to
pick the right hash function for a particular problem. Here are some general
suggestions:

* If you use Bloom filters to speed up access to a key-value store, you might
want to look at [xxh3](https://github.com/zeebo/xxh3) or [xxhash](
https://github.com/cespare/xxhash).
* If your keys are cryptographic hashes, consider using the first 8 bytes of those hashes.
* If you use Bloom filters to make probabilistic decisions, a randomized hash
function such as [maphash](https://golang.org/pkg/hash/maphash) should prevent
the same false positives occurring every time.

When evaluating a hash function, or designing a custom one,
make sure it is a 64-bit hash that properly mixes its input bits.
Casting a 32-bit hash to uint64 gives suboptimal results.
So does passing integer keys in without running them through a mixing function.
