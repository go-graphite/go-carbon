##### version 0.14.0
* Accept UDP messages in plain protocol without trailing newline
* Added `whisper.hard-max-creates-per-second` option #242
* No longer trying to combine separate UDP messages from one sender into single stream
* [carbonserver] Added metrics for prometheus

##### version 0.13.0
* Added `whisper.max-creates-per-second` option
* Support multiple targets in carbonserver
* Support new `carbonapi_v3_pb` protocol. This allows recent versions of carbonapi to get metadata alongside with data

##### version 0.12.0
* [Tags](http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tags.html) support was added (only with [graphite-web](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web))
* flock support for persister and carbonserver
* `cache.max-size` and `cache.write-strategy` can be changed without restart (HUP signal)
* Google PubSub protocol was added. It receives data from PubSub Subscriptions and can decode protobuf, plain, or pickle messages.
  * The default format is plain. Specify protobuf or pickle by adding an attribute named 'content-type' to the PubSub messsages:
    * application/protobuf
    * application/python-pickle
  * Sample configuration:
```
[receiver.pubsub]
protocol = "pubsub"
project = "project-name"
subscription = "subscription-name"
# receiver_go_routines = 4
# receiver_max_messages = 1000
# receiver_max_bytes = 500000000 # default 500MB
```

##### version 0.11.0
* GRPC api for query cache was added
* Added support for an unlimited number of receivers
* Protobuf protocol was added. Sample configuration:
```
[receiver.protobuf]
protocol = "protobuf"
listen = ":2005"
```
* HTTP protocol was added. It receives data from POST requests body. Data can be encoded in plain, pickle (Content-Type: application/python-pickle) and protobuf (Content-Type: application/protobuf) formats. Sample configuration:
```
[receiver.http]
protocol = "http"
listen = ":2006"
```

* Kafka protocol was added. It receives data from Kafka and can decode protobuf, plain or pickle messages. You need manually specify message format in the config file. Sample configuration:
```
[receiver.kafka]
protocol = "kafka"
parse-protocol = "protobuf" # can be also "plain" or "pickle"
brokers = [ "localhost:9092" ]
topic = "graphite"
partition = 0
state-file = "/var/lib/graphite/kafka.state"
initial-offset = "-30m" # In case of absent or damaged state file fetch last 30 mins of messages
```

##### version 0.10.0
Breaking changes:

* common: logfile and log-level in common config section are deprecated
* changed config defaults:
  * user changed to `carbon`
  * whisper directory changed to `/var/lib/graphite/whisper/`
  * schemas config changed to `/etc/go-carbon/storage-schemas.conf`
* rpm:
  * binary moved to `/usr/bin/go-carbon`
  * configs moved to `/etc/go-carbon/`
* deb:
  * binary moved to `/usr/bin/go-carbon`

Other changes:

* common: Requires Go 1.8 or newer
* common: Logging refactored. Format changed to structured JSON. Added support of multiple logging handlers with separate output, level and encoding
* dump/restore: New dump format. Added `go-carbon -cat filename` command for printing dump to console. New version of go-carbon can read old dump
* dump/restore: [fix] go-carbon can not stop after dump (with enabled dump and carbonserver)
* carbonserver: [feature] IdleTimeout is now configurable in carbonserver part
* carbonserver: [feature] support /render query cache (query-cache-\* options in config file)
* carbonserver: [feature] support /metrics/find cache (find-cache-\* option in config file)
* carbonserver: [feature] support /metrics/details handler, that returns information about metrics (require enabled trigram-index)
* carbonserver: [feature] Add config option to disable trigram index (before that to disable index you should set scan-interval to 0)
* carbonserver: [fix] fix #146 (metrics_known was broken if metrics were not sent as counters)

##### version 0.9.1
