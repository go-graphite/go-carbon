go-carbon [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lomik/go-carbon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lomik/go-carbon)
============

Golang implementation of Graphite/Carbon server with classic architecture: Agent -> Cache -> Persister

![Architecture](doc/design.png)

### Features
- Receive metrics from TCP and UDP ([plaintext protocol](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol))
- Receive metrics with [Pickle protocol](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-pickle-protocol) (TCP only)
- [storage-schemas.conf](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-schemas-conf)
- [storage-aggregation.conf](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-aggregation-conf)
- Carbonlink (requests to cache from graphite-web)
- Logging with rotation (reopen log by HUP signal or inotify event)
- Many persister workers (using many cpu cores)
- Run as daemon
- Optional dump/restore restart on `USR2` signal (config `dump` section): stop persister, start write new data to file, dump cache to file, stop all (and restore from files after next start)
- Reload some config options without restart (HUP signal):
  - `whisper` section of main config, `storage-schemas.conf` and `storage-aggregation.conf`
  - `graph-prefix`, `metric-interval`, `metric-endpoint`, `max-cpu` from `common` section
  - `dump` section

## Performance

Faster than default carbon. In all conditions :) How much faster depends on server hardware, storage-schemas, etc.

The result of replacing "carbon" to "go-carbon" on a server with a load up to 900 thousand metric per minute:

### OS tuning
It is crucial for performance to ensure that your OS tuned so that go-carbon
is never blocked on writes, usually that involves adjusting following sysctl
params on Linux systems:

```bash
# percentage of your RAM which can be left unwritten to disk. MUST be much more than
# your write rate, which is usually one FS block size (4KB) per metric.
sysctl -w vm.dirty_ratio = 80

# percentage of yout RAM when background writer have to kick in and
# start writes to disk. Make it way above the value you see in `/proc/meminfo|grep Dirty`
# so that it doesn't interefere with dirty_expire_centisecs explained below
sysctl -w vm.dirty_background_ratio = 50

# allow page to be left dirty no longer than 10 mins
# if unwritten page stays longer than time set here,
# kernel starts writing it out
sysctl -w vm.dirty_expire_centisecs = $(( 10*60*100 ))
```

Net effect of these 3 params is that with `dirty_*_ratio` params set high
enough multiple updates to a metric don't trigger disk activity. Multiple datapoint
writes are coalesced into single disk write which kernel then writes to disk
in a background.

With settings above applied, best write-strategy to use is "noop"
